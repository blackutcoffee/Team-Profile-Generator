# Team Profile Generator
**Team Profile Generator** is a **Node.js** command line application for generating Employee Summary applications. Users can input various number of team members, plus they can be a mix of engineering internships. Upon completion, the application dynamically outputs an HTML file that displays all selected project classes per PII provided via user.

## Installation
Clone Repos locally then install required dependencies via command line interface
```
npm i
```
//Dependencies are as follows: Jest for running validation tests; Inquirer for collecting user input.

//Functionality Speaking, unit testing enables developers to build inherited classes as necessary.
// Recommended Workflow:

// 1. Run tests
// 2. Create or update classes to pass a single test case
// 3. RinseRepeat

// ðŸŽ— Remember, run the tests with `npm run test`

// Recommended directory structure similar to the following:

// 
// lib/           // Classes Library
// output/        // Promised output
// templates/     // HTML Prototypical Template(s)
// test/          // Jest
//   Employee.test.js
//   Engineer.test.js
//   Intern.test.js
//   Manager.test.js


## Usage

// Developed using OOP concepts, chiefly classes and constructors created "team member" objects based on information entered by end-users. 
//This app deploys Test-Driven Development concepts as well. Jest is used to perform audits on all the class constructors to ensure they function properly. FS node module utilizes dynamically generated HTML files from strings via JavaScript.

## Technologies Utilized
* **Inquirer** - For Procuring User Input Via CLI Prompts
* **FS** - Auto Populates HTML 
* **HTML** - Template for Front-End Markup
* **Bootstrap** - Deployed on UI Utilizing classes
* **JS** - For Both Functionality And Dynamically Created Documents
* **Jest** - Constructor Functionality Testing
